My name is Rajesh, and I’m a software engineer and manager with over 20 years of experience in the industry. Over the years, I’ve encountered countless scenarios that have shaped my understanding of software engineering management. My motivation for writing this blog is simple: to share those real-world scenarios and insights with others who are considering or growing in this role.

Unlike discussions filled with jargon or abstract theories, my focus will be on practical, scenario-based lessons. I hope these articles provide you with inspiration, perspectives, or simply a sense of familiarity in your own journey. In these writings, when I use the term “manager,” I’m referring to the role of leading and supporting people, regardless of rank or hierarchy.

For a long time, I’ve wanted to document my thoughts on engineering management. Initially, I considered platforms like LinkedIn, but I realized I rarely read newsletters myself. So, I decided to publish on GitHub, appreciating its simplicity and flexibility. I hope this format helps me learn from the world outside while sharing what I’ve learned.

If these articles resonate with you or spark meaningful discussions, I’d be delighted to hear your thoughts. Cheers to learning and growing together!
