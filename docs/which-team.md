<h2> Which team are you on? </h2>

Ganesh recently appointed Sriram as the new manager to lead a key team in his organization. This team was critical to the success of the company's mainline product, the cornerstone of its business. While the team excelled in their core responsibilities, they struggled with burnout and inefficiencies. They believed that the Product team and management could alleviate their workload, but help wasn’t forthcoming.

From his first days on the job, Sriram recognized these challenges. During a team meeting, he shared a candid message:

"Team, I am thrilled to be here. I’ve had one-on-one discussions with each of you and my own manager to better understand our goals and needs. I’ve come across some ideas, and I’ll share them with you in the coming weeks.

I understand my responsibility to ensure your well-being and growth as a team. At the same time, I also have deliverables to meet for my manager. This requires us all to act as negotiators—balancing our efficiency with the business’s demands. I encourage you to bring forward your ideas, take ownership, and remain open to feedback and adjustments. It can be challenging to put your ideas on the table and accept change, but that’s the first step to making them flourish. Rest assured, I’ll advocate for these ideas with my team and ensure they get the attention they deserve from all relevant stakeholders. But we can only make this happen if we believe, as a team, in the necessity of certain steps.

If you have questions or need clarity, I’m here to assist. I look forward to collaborating with you all. Take care, and see you at the next meeting."

Sriram’s message struck a chord, but it also left some team members curious. James, one of the team members, reflected: “What did Sriram mean by “I’ll advocate for these ideas with my team and ensure they get the attention they deserve”? Which team was he referring to?”
